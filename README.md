## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

**"Permission denied" accessing contacts:**
- System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Contacts
- Add Terminal (for Python) or Script Editor (for AppleScript)

**Python modules not installing:**
```bash
pip3 install --user pyobjc-framework-AddressBook
pip3 install --user google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
```

**AppleScript timeout with many contacts:**
- Split export into groups in Contacts app
